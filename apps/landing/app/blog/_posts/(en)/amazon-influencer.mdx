Let's dive deep into the most effective approaches:

### 1. Leveraging Amazon Live and #FoundItOnAmazon

This platform offers unique insights into an influencer's presentation style, product knowledge, and audience interaction capabilities.

The #FoundItOnAmazon feed serves as a curated collection of influencer-recommended products, making it an excellent resource for identifying creators in your specific niche. This feed aggregates content from various influencers, allowing you to:
