## Introduction

The evolution of e-commerce search has taken an exciting leap forward with Amazon's introduction of COSMO, a groundbreaking artificial intelligence system that transforms how we discover products on the platform. Moving away from the traditional A9 algorithm, which primarily focused on keyword matching and product attributes, COSMO brings a fresh perspective to online shopping. This sophisticated AI is designed to enhance the shopping experience by understanding the deeper intentions behind customer queries. By leveraging advanced techniques like large language models (LLMs) and user-centric common sense knowledge, COSMO creates expansive knowledge graphs that inform its recommendations and search results.
With COSMO now in play, Amazon is redefining what it means to shop online. Imagine searching for "winter clothes" and receiving suggestions that truly resonate with your needs—like cozy jackets or warm sweaters—rather than just a list of items that happen to contain those keywords. This intuitive approach not only makes finding the right products easier but also adds a personal touch to the shopping journey. By interpreting user intent more accurately, COSMO enhances customer satisfaction and boosts sales conversions, paving the way for a new era of personalized online shopping that feels more tailored and engaging than ever before.
