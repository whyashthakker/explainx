### 2.3 Inventory and Supply Chain Management

AI systems can predict demand patterns, optimize inventory levels, and streamline supply chain operations. This reduces costs associated with overstocking or stockouts while ensuring product availability.

Example: Walmart has implemented AI-powered inventory management systems that analyze sales data, weather forecasts, and seasonal trends to predict demand and optimize stock levels across their extensive product catalog.

### 2.4 Visual Search and Image Recognition

AI-powered visual search allows customers to find products by uploading images rather than typing text queries, significantly enhancing the shopping experience.

Example: Pinterest's Lens feature enables users to take photos of products they like and find similar items available for purchase, demonstrating how visual AI can transform product discovery.
