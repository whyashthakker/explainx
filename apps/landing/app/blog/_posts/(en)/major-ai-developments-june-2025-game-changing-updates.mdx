## 3. Meta Introduces V-JEPA 2: Revolutionary World Model for Physical Reasoning

![Meta Introduced V-JEPA 2](/images/blog-posts/meta-v-jepa-2.jpeg)

Meta has unveiled V-JEPA 2, a groundbreaking 1.2 billion-parameter world model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in visual understanding and prediction of the physical world. This model represents a significant advancement toward advanced machine intelligence (AMI) by enabling AI systems to understand, predict, and plan actions in physical environments. Trained on over 1 million hours of video and 1 million images, V-JEPA 2 can perform zero-shot robot planning and control in unfamiliar environments. The model demonstrates impressive capabilities in pick-and-place tasks with 65-80% success rates using only visual subgoals. Meta has also released three new benchmarks to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities, revealing significant gaps between current AI models and human performance that indicate important areas for future development.

### Core Architecture Components:
- **Encoder**: Processes raw video input into semantic embeddings capturing world state information
- **Predictor**: Takes video embeddings and context to output predicted future states
- **Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**: Self-supervised learning framework for video understanding
- **Two-Phase Training**: Actionless pre-training followed by action-conditioned fine-tuning
- **Model Scale**: 1.2 billion parameters optimized for physical world understanding

### Training Dataset & Methodology:
- **Pre-training Data**: 1 million+ hours of diverse video content and 1 million images
- **Robot Training Data**: Only 62 hours from DROID dataset for action-conditioned learning
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: No human annotation required for initial training
- **Zero-Shot Deployment**: Direct deployment on new robots without environment-specific training
