With over 40% of global online sales happening on Amazon, it's a goldmine for businesses of all sizes. But before diving in, you need to know exactly what it costs to sell on Amazon.

## Understanding the Basic Amazon Fees Structure

When it comes to Amazon seller fees, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The fees vary based on multiple factors, including your chosen selling plan, product category, and fulfillment method. Let's break down these essential costs that every seller needs to understand.

The basic Amazon seller fees structure consists of several key components that work together:

1. Subscription Fees: Your choice between Individual and Professional selling plans affects your monthly costs and per-item fees.

2. Referral Fees: These percentage-based fees vary by category and can significantly impact your profit margins. For example:
   - Electronics typically have a 8% referral fee
   - Clothing and accessories carry a 17% fee
   - Jewelry can go up to 20%
   - Most other categories range between 8% and 15%
