# AMC vs DSP Audiences: Understanding the Key Differences

![Amazon AMC vs DSP Audience ](/images/blog/amazon-amc-vs-dsp-audience.jpeg)

Amazon's advertising ecosystem offers two powerful platforms for audience targeting: Amazon DSP (Demand Side Platform) and AMC (Amazon Marketing Cloud). While both serve the essential purpose of reaching potential customers, they differ significantly in their capabilities and approach. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key differences between AMC and DSP audiences.

## Understanding the Funnel in Amazon DSP Marketing

In digital marketing, particularly within Amazon's Demand-Side Platform (DSP), understanding the different stages of the marketing funnel is crucial for effectively targeting potential customers. The funnel is typically divided into three main stages: Top of Funnel (ToF), Middle of Funnel (MoF), and Bottom of Funnel (BoF). Each stage has distinct targeting strategies designed to engage consumers at various points in their purchasing journey.

### Top of Funnel (ToF)

The Top of Funnel stage is focused on **building brand awareness** and attracting a broad audience. This is where potential customers may not yet be aware of your brand or products but are exploring various options. Effective strategies at this stage include:

- In-Market Audiences: This strategy targets individuals whose recent shopping behaviors indicate they are likely to purchase within a specific subcategory. For example, if you sell fitness equipment, targeting those who have shown interest in health and fitness products can yield significant results.

- Lifestyle Audiences: These audiences are categorized based on their lifestyle choices and behaviors. For instance, targeting consumers who have recently purchased a new car can be effective if you sell automotive accessories.

- Behavioral Targeting: This involves reaching individuals based on their past actions, such as browsing specific categories or viewing product videos. This approach is particularly useful for creating awareness among potential customers who have shown interest in similar products.

- Demographic and Device Targeting: By focusing on specific demographic traits (age, gender, location) and the devices used by potential customers, brands can tailor their messages to resonate more effectively with their target audience.

### Middle of Funnel (MoF)

The Middle of Funnel stage aims to engage consumers who are actively considering their options. Here, the focus shifts to more targeted strategies that encourage potential customers to evaluate your products against competitors:

- Competitor Conquesting: This strategy targets shoppers who have viewed competitor products but did not make a purchase. By presenting your offerings, you can entice these consumers to consider your brand instead.

- Search Prospecting: This involves reaching consumers who have encountered your product in search results, reinforcing brand visibility and encouraging further exploration.

- Complementary Products Targeting: Targeting shoppers who have purchased related products can effectively cross-sell items from your catalog. For instance, if someone buys a camera, targeting them with offers for camera accessories can enhance sales opportunities.

- Contextual Targeting: This strategy focuses on placing ads in contexts that align with consumer interests, such as websites or apps related to the product category, thereby increasing relevance and engagement.

### Bottom of Funnel (BoF)

The Bottom of Funnel stage is where conversion becomes the primary focus. Here, the goal is to turn interested consumers into paying customers through targeted strategies:

- Retargeting: This involves re-engaging shoppers who previously viewed your products without making a purchase. By reminding them of their interest, you can increase the likelihood of conversion.

- Retention Strategies: Focusing on previous customers from the last year can help nurture loyalty and encourage repeat purchases. Engaging these customers with personalized offers can significantly boost retention rates.

- Cross-Selling: Targeting existing customers who have purchased other products from your catalog allows for effective cross-selling opportunities, maximizing customer lifetime value.

## AMC Audiences: The Advanced Evolution

Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) represents a significant advancement in audience targeting, providing advertisers with enhanced capabilities compared to the traditional Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP). By leveraging AMC, brands can achieve more precise and effective marketing strategies throughout the customer journey. Below are key advantages of AMC over DSP.

### 1. Deeper Behavioral Insights
AMC allows advertisers to target audiences based on specific actions that are not tracked by DSP, enabling a more nuanced understanding of consumer behavior. Key insights include:
- Cart Abandonment Behavior: Target users who added items to their cart but did not complete the purchase, allowing for tailored follow-up ads.
- Wish List Additions: Reach consumers who have shown interest by adding products to their wish lists, signaling potential future purchases.
- Specific Keyword Search Histories: Engage users based on their search queries, allowing brands to connect with shoppers actively looking for related products.
- Complete Customer Journey Mapping: Analyze the entire path a customer takes from initial awareness to final purchase, facilitating more informed targeting.
- Multiple Touchpoint Interactions: Identify and target users who have interacted with your brand across various channels, enhancing engagement strategies.

### 2. Enhanced Frequency Control
AMC offers advanced frequency management features that surpass the basic controls available in DSP:
- Long-Term Frequency Management: Monitor and adjust ad exposure over extended periods to optimize engagement without overwhelming the audience.
- Lifetime Frequency Capping: Set caps on how often an individual sees your ads throughout their entire interaction with your brand.
- Comprehensive Ad Exposure Control: Gain insights into how frequently your ads are shown across different platforms and adjust accordingly.
- Better Protection Against Ad Fatigue: Reduce the risk of ad fatigue by managing how often users encounter your promotional content.

### 3. Extended Historical Reach
One of AMC's most notable advantages is its ability to utilize historical data for audience targeting:
- Interactions Beyond DSP's 90-Day Limit: Target users based on interactions that occurred over a year ago, allowing for more strategic retargeting efforts.
- Sophisticated Repeat Customer Strategies: Leverage historical data to create targeted campaigns aimed at re-engaging previous customers, particularly beneficial for products with longer purchase cycles.

### 4. Custom Audience Creation
AMC provides unparalleled customization options for audience targeting:
- SQL Query Support for Precise Audience Definition: Utilize SQL queries to build highly specific audience segments based on detailed criteria.
- Integration of First-Party Data Signals: Combine first-party data with behavioral insights to create robust audience profiles.
- Ability to Combine Multiple Data Sources: Merge data from various channels and touchpoints for a comprehensive view of customer interactions.
- Custom Audience Refinement Based on Specific Search Terms: Tailor audiences based on particular keywords or phrases relevant to your products.

### 5. Advanced Targeting Examples
AMC enables sophisticated targeting strategies that enhance marketing effectiveness:
- Precision Customer Acquisition: Target new customers by combining prebuilt audiences with specific search term requirements to capture high-intent shoppers.
- Precision Retargeting: Focus on users based on specific page view frequency ranges, ensuring that advertising efforts are directed at those most likely to convert.
- Add to Cart Retargeting: Specifically target recent cart abandoners within a 7-day window, increasing the chances of recovering lost sales.

## Making the Right Choice

Making the right choice between Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP) and Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) is essential for optimizing audience targeting strategies. Each platform offers unique advantages tailored to different marketing needs. While DSP provides a solid foundation for advertisers, particularly those new to Amazon advertising or seeking straightforward retargeting solutions, AMC represents a more advanced evolution in audience sophistication. It allows for deeper insights, extended historical data access, and highly customized audience segments. Hereâ€™s when to use each platform:

### Use DSP When:
- Starting with Amazon advertising: Ideal for beginners who need a user-friendly interface and quick setup.
- Needing quick access to pre-built audiences: DSP offers various pre-defined audience segments that can be immediately targeted.
- Running straightforward retargeting campaigns: Suitable for basic retargeting efforts without complex requirements.
- Working with standard conversion windows: Best for campaigns that do not require extended historical data or sophisticated targeting.

### Use AMC When:
- Requiring deeper behavioral targeting: AMC allows for targeting based on specific actions like cart abandonment and wish list additions.
- Needing extended historical data access: It enables retargeting of shoppers from beyond the 90-day limit set by DSP.
- Managing complex frequency capping requirements: AMC offers advanced frequency control, including lifetime caps to prevent ad fatigue.
-Integrating multiple data sources: It supports combining first-party data with various datasets for more refined audience creation.
- Creating highly customized audience segments: AMC allows for precise audience definition using SQL queries and specific search terms.
