## Introduction

Effective inventory management is essential for Amazon sellers, as it can greatly influence profitability and operational efficiency. With the platform's evolving storage policies, understanding how to optimize fulfillment center space while maintaining healthy inventory levels is crucial.
By staying informed about these changes and implementing smart management strategies, sellers can position themselves for long-term success. Key tactics include setting clear inventory goals, categorizing products based on demand, and leveraging inventory management software for tracking and reporting. Regular audits and accurate demand forecasting are also vital to prevent overstocking and stockouts.
With the right approach, Amazon sellers can enhance their inventory practices, leading to better profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Understanding FBA Storage Limits

Amazon's Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program now operates with a streamlined monthly capacity limit system, replacing the previous weekly restock and quarterly storage limits. Here's what you need to know:

- **Monthly Capacity System**: Sellers now have a single monthly limit, simplifying inventory planning.
- **IPI Score Impact**: Your Inventory Performance Index (IPI) directly affects your storage allowance, with higher scores granting greater capacity.
- **Measurement Metrics**: Storage limits are tracked in both units and cubic feet, allowing for better inventory management.
- **Seasonal Considerations**: Adjustments are made for peak shopping periods, ensuring sellers can meet demand effectively.

## Long-Term Storage Fees Explained

Long-term storage fees can have a considerable effect on your profitability as an Amazon seller. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

1. **Standard Long-Term Storage Fee:** A monthly fee is charged for items that have been stored for an extended period, which can add up quickly.
2. **Additional Costs:** Regular monthly storage fees continue to apply alongside long-term storage fees, further impacting your expenses.
3. **Impact Areas:** These fees affect all product categories, making it essential to monitor inventory across the board.
4. **Calculation Period:** Long-term storage fees are assessed regularly, so staying on top of your inventory turnover is crucial.

Being aware of these fees and managing your inventory effectively can help you avoid unnecessary costs and maintain a healthier bottom line.
